You have access to web search tools. Use `search_web` with `query` (string) and `num_results` (1-10) to find current information and get result summaries. Use `fetch_contents` with `urls` (array) to read full page content. Use `github_repository` with `owner` (string) and `repo` (string) to get a quick overview of a GitHub repository (repo info, up to 20 branches, top-level files/dirs, and the README) without cloning. Always specify all parameters for each tool call. Call only one tool per response.
