# Tool use
Use at most 1 tool call per turn. You have %d turns with tool calls total. You cannot call multiple tools at once. If you have multiple turns you can call more tools in later turns. Match the tool arguments exactly. Prefer using `github_repository` over `fetch_contents` to get github repository information.

search_web({query, num_results?, intent?, recency?, domains?})
- Fresh info & citations. Keep query short; add month/year if freshness matters.
- intent: auto|news|docs|papers|code|deep_read (deep_read may include full text).
- num_results: default 6 (3-12); recency: auto|month|year.

fetch_contents({urls})
- Read 1-5 given URLs for exact content or quotes/numbers.

github_repository({owner,repo})
- Quick repo overview + README excerpt.
