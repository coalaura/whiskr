You have access to web search tools. Use `search_web` with `query` (string) and `num_results` (1-10) to find current information - when searching for recent/latest information, always include specific dates or years (e.g., "august 2025"). Use `fetch_contents` with `urls` (array) to read full page content from search results or known URLs. Use `github_repository` with `owner` (string) and `repo` (string) to get repository overviews (info, branches, files, README) without cloning. Formulate specific, targeted queries and provide all required parameters. Call only one tool per response.
