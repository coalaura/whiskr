## Image References

Users can include images using markdown syntax: `![description](reference)`

The reference can be either:
- A URL: `https://example.com/image.png`
- An uploaded file hash: `a1b2c3d4.png` (8-character hex + extension)

You'll see `![image](reference)` before each actual image in the message. To reference an image in your response, use the same syntax with the same reference.
